        My current research focuses on developing machine learning (ML) and Bayesian statistical methods for applications in epidemiology. For example, I recently developed a localized spatiotemporal random forest model to study COVID-19 dynamics across US counties, capturing how epidemiological, demographic, and environmental drivers shift across regions and periods. I also collaborated in applying Bayesian frameworks, including distributed lag non-linear models, to quantify uncertainty and evaluate delayed environmental effects, such as temperature on Salmonella risk across New South Wales local health districts. These methods provide more accurate, interpretable, and actionable insights to support early interventions and inform public health decision-making.

        Looking ahead, I am interested in integrating causal inference with modern ML for applications in epidemiology, estimating intervention effects and enable counterfactual reasoning. This direction could disentangle the impacts of policies, vaccination campaigns, and environmental exposures on disease outcomes, guiding adaptive, evidence-based strategies. In addition, I am developing an interest in ML for biological data, particularly spatial transcriptomics and cellular microenvironments, where such methods can uncover biomarkers, characterize tissue heterogeneity, and advance precision medicine.
