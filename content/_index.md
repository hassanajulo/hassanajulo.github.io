      title: 'Current and Future Research Work'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My current work focuses on advancing machine learning methods for spatial epidemiology. Traditional epidemiological models often struggle to capture nonlinear spatial and temporal dependencies and interactions among multiple risk factors. To address this, I have been developing approaches that integrate spatial autocorrelation, temporal structure, and machine learning to improve outbreak prediction, hotspot detection, and disease risk mapping. For example, I created a novel local spatiotemporal random forest model to study the dynamics of COVID-19 incidence across United States counties. This framework adapts to both geographic and temporal variations, capturing how epidemiological, demographic, and environmental drivers shift across regions and over time. Such methods yield more accurate and actionable results, supporting early intervention strategies and better allocation of health resources.

        In parallel, I employ Bayesian statistical methods to study spatiotemporal disease dynamics. Bayesian frameworks allow the incorporation of prior knowledge and provide rigorous quantification of uncertainty, which is especially critical when data are heterogeneous across regions and periods. For instance, I have applied Bayesian distributed lag non-linear models to capture delayed effects of environmental exposures, such as temperature, on Salmonella disease risk in New South Wales, Australia. This approach not only improves interpretability but also produces reliable estimates with quantified uncertainty, enabling more trustworthy insights for public health decision-making.

        Building on this foundation, I am developing a growing interest in extending my research into deep learning methods for spatial biology, particularly in the context of spatial transcriptomics and cellular microenvironments. While I have not yet conducted substantial work in this area, I am drawn to the unique capabilities of deep learning for modeling high-dimensional, spatially structured biological data. My aim is to eventually leverage these approaches to uncover novel biomarkers, characterize tissue heterogeneity, and better understand spatial organization in biological systems. This line of research has the potential to contribute significantly to cancer biology, neuroscience, and precision medicine.

        Looking further ahead, I am also interested in exploring explainable Bayesian deep learning methods for applications across epidemiology, biology, and environmental science. I am particularly motivated by the principled mechanisms for uncertainty quantification offered by Bayesian approaches, which are crucial in biomedical contexts where decisions can have profound consequences. Although this remains an emerging direction for me, I envision combining Bayesian deep learning with explainability frameworks to create models that are not only accurate but also transparent, trustworthy, and actionable. Such methods could, for example, provide outbreak predictions with quantified confidence levels in epidemiology, enable robust biomarker discovery with interpretable biological insights, or support climate and air quality forecasts with uncertainty estimates in environmental science.
